## Analysis Details
The analysis employs various statistical tests, including Chi-Square, Spearman Rank, and Kruskal-Wallis tests, to evaluate relationships between music exploratory behavior, frequency of listening to music genres, and perceived mental health effects. Visualizations are generated to illustrate the findings effectively.

## Results
This study offers recommendations on utilizing music for better mental health. However, these findings are based on participants aged under 40 and are subject to personal preferences. Therefore, the results may not apply to everyone, but they are worth exploring:
- Being a music explorer and trying various genres outside your favorites may enhance mental well-being.
- A higher frequency of listening to Pop and Rock music is linked to increased anxiety levels; itâ€™s advisable to avoid these genres when experiencing anxiety.
- Listening to R&B and upbeat Pop music is associated with better mental health.
- The positive association of Pop with anxiety and mental health may arise from the variety within the genre. Energetic, cheerful Pop songs may improve mental health, while melancholic, emotionally intense Pop songs could induce anxiety in some listeners.
